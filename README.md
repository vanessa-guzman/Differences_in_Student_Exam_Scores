# Differences in Student Exam Scores

**Tools:** RStudio, R, Tableau, Google Slides <br />
**R Packages:** tidyverse <br />
**Skills:** data analysis, data visualization (in Tableau) <br />
**Objective:** Examine differences in student exam scores. <br />

**About the data:** The data contains information about student exam scores in 3 subjects (math, reading, and writing). It also includes demographic information about the students and whether or not students completed an exam preparation course. The data can be found on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/whenamancodes/students-performance-in-exams).

**What was done:**
* Explored student demographic information
* Provided descriptive statistics of student exam scores
* Compared exam scores of students based on a test preparation, gender, and parental education

**Deliverables:** 
* [Tableau Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/vanessa4875/viz/StudentExamScores/StudentDemographics_1)
* Presentation available as a [pdf in this repository](https://github.com/vanessa-guzman/Differences_in_Student_Exam_Scores/blob/main/Presentation-%20Differences%20in%20Student%20Exam%20Scores.pdf) *OR* on [Google Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Wb9RZexRPE4cv4MiQllDhPUfzxv-rtiEOLy2ymaiUKk/edit#slide=id.g2071186f1f7_0_0)

**Extra: Independent Samples T-Tests**

In order to practice running statistical tests in R, I also used this dataset to run an **independent samples t-test** to determine whether there were statistically significant differences in test scores between students who completed the exam preparation course and students who did not. This code was not used when creating the Tableau dashboard.

The code can be found in this repository under the name [Practice-T-Tests-Code-- Student Exam Scores](https://github.com/vanessa-guzman/Differences_in_Student_Exam_Scores/blob/main/Practice-T-Tests-Code--Student-Exam-Scores.md)
